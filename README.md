# Leetmetric
 It's a tool used by developers to track their progress on LeetCode. It generally provides insights into the questions you've completed.
 
# To run leetmetric
  Make sure that your browser is connected to the proxy server 
  . If you want to try out this then use CORS Anywhere, visit "https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/" and click on the "Request temporary access to the demo server" button, to temporarily restore the full functionality of CORS Anywhere for your client only.
 # Challenges faced in building this up
 . Biggest task was to fetch the leetcode API as they have proper security
 . I made it to by using  CORS ANYWHERE  which build a proxy server between our browser and leetcode
